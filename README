NAME
    CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB - BerkeleyDB CGI::Session driver

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::Session qw/-api3/;
        $session = new CGI::Session("driver:BerkeleyDB", undef,
                                        {Directory=>'/tmp'} );

    For more examples, consult the CGI::Session manpage manual

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB is a CGI::Session driver to store session data
    in BerkeleyDB 2.x or better. If you have older version of BerkeleyDB,
    use DB_File driver instead.

    To write your own drivers for CGI::Session refere to the CGI::Session
    manpage manual.

    The driver requires both BerkeleyDB and the BerkeleyDB manpage Perl
    interface installed. You can download latest version of BerkeleyDB from
    http://www.sleepycat.com . Latest release of the BerkeleyDB manpage Perl
    interface can be acquired from your nearest CPAN mirror.

ATTRIBUTES
    The only driver attribute required is Directory, which denotes the
    location where session database and necessary locks to be stored. By
    default, name of the session database file is "cgisess.db". If you'd
    rather use a different name, there's FileName attribute you can set:

        $session = new CGI::Session("driver:BerkeleyDB", undef,
                        {Directory=>'/tmp', FileName=>'my_sessions.db'});
