NAME
    CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB - Driver for CGI::Session

SYNOPSIS
        use constant COOKIE => "TEST_SID";  # cookie to store the session id

        use CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB;
        use CGI;

        my $cgi = new CGI;

        # getting the
        my $c_sid = $cgi->cookie(COOKIE) || undef;

        my $session = new CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB($c_sid,
            {
                LockDirectory   =>'/tmp/locks',
                FileName        => '/tmp/sessions.db'
            });

        # now let's create a sid cookie and send it to the client's browser.
        # if it is an existing session, it will be the same as before,
        # but if it's a new session, $session->id() will return a new session id.
        {
            my $new_cookie = $cgi->cookie(-name=>COOKIE, -value=>$session->id);
            print $cgi->header(-cookie=>$new_cookie);
        }

        print $cgi->start_html("CGI::Session::File");

        # assuming we already saved the users first name in the session
        # when he visited it couple of days ago, we can greet him with
        # his first name

        print "Hello", $session->param("f_name"), ", how have you been?";

        print $cgi->end_html();

DESCRIPTION
    "CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB" is the driver for "CGI::Session" to store and
    retrieve the session data in and from the Berkeley DB 2.x or better. For
    this you need to have the BerkeleyDB manpage installed properly. To be
    able to write your own drivers for the the CGI::Session manpage, please
    consult developer section of the manual.

    Constructor requires two arguments, as all other the CGI::Session
    manpage drivers do. The first argument has to be session id to be
    initialized (or undef to tell the the CGI::Session manpage to create a
    new session id). The second argument has to be a reference to a hash
    with a following required key/value pair:

    If you do not have BerkeleyDB 2.x or better, you are better of going
    with the CGI::Session::DB_File manpage, which is an interface for
    BerkeleyDB 1.x.

    "Filename"
        path to a file where all the session data will be stored

    "CGI::Session::BerkeleyDB" uses Data::Dumper to serialize the session
    data before storing it in the session file.

    For examples of the "CGI::Session" usage, please refer to CGI::Session
    manual
